    "\n",
    "> **Property type**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Prospective borrowers submit loan applications for various types of structures: one- to four-unit properties, multifamily properties and manufactured homes. For this analysis, we focused on one- to four-unit properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Occupancy**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We included only borrowers who said they planned to live in the house they were looking to buy. We did this to exclude developers or individuals who were buying property as an investment or to subsequently flip it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Action Type**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We wanted to look at the reasons lending institutions deny people a mortgage. After conversations with former officials at HUD, we decided to include only those applications that resulted in originations (action type 1) or denials (action type 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Income**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> An applicant’s income isn’t always reported in the data. In other cases, the data cuts off any incomes over \\\\$9.9 million and any loan amounts over \\\\$99.9 million, meaning there’s a value in the database, but it’s not precise. We focused only on those records where income and loan amount have an accurate estimation. This meant discarding about 1 percent of all conventional home loans in the country for 2016. [Note: I already edited this]\n",
    ">\n",
    "> When we plotted the number of applicants, how much money they made and the size of the loan, we found that it skewed to the left, meaning the majority of applicants were clustered on the lower end of the income and loan amount scales. This was especially true for applicants of color. We took the logarithm transformation of income and loan amount to normalize the distribution of those variables and limit the effect of extreme outliers.\n",
    "\n",

    ">\n",
    "> We included all cases in our analysis regardless of lien status.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Race and ethnicity**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> At first, we looked at race separate from ethnicity, but that approach introduced too many instances in which​ ​either the ethnicity or race was unknown. So we decided to combine race and ethnicity. Applicants who marked their ethnicity as Hispanic were grouped together as Hispanic/Latino regardless of race. Non-Hispanic applicants, as well as those who didn’t provide an ethnicity, were grouped together by race: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, etc. **[Note: This has already been taken care of]**\n",
    "\n",
